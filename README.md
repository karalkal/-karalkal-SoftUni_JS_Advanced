<h3>This repo contains the solutions of problems from SoftUni's JS Advanced course.</h3>
<i>Please note, the first chapters don't in any way fit the "advanced" description as many students are coming from different educational paths (myself from Python and Django for example) and some familiarization with the syntax and other specifics of the language were required.</i>
