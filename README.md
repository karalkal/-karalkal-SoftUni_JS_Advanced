<h3>This repo contains the solutions of problems from SoftUni's JS Advanced course.</h3>
<i>Please note, the first chapters are deliberately made to be far from advanced as many students are coming from different educational paths (myself from Python and Django for example) and obviousel we needed some time to adjust to the syntax and other specifics of the language.</i>
